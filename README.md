Minimal Isomorphic (Universal) React Example
==================================================
Simple demonstration of how one can build an isomorphic javascript application with ReactJS


Getting Started
---------------

Install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the examples:

```
$ npm start
```

This should open up the nonisomorphic example in your browser.

Open up `http:localhost:3000` in your browser to see the isomorphic app.


Notice there is a 2 second delay before the app is mounted in both examples but the isomorphic example will display app content immediately.
